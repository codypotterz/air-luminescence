This application demonstrates the generation of optical photons (scintillation photons) from the interaction
of accelerated alpha particles with air at NTP conditions. It computes the track length of alpha particles, 
the deposited energy per alpha particle in air, as well as the spectrum of radioluminescence photons that are 
emitted along the track of the alphas. Also, the distribution of radioluminescence photons that pass through
a surface of (50x10)mm is simulated by activating the FlatSurfaceCurrent primitive scorer in the alphabeam.mac
file.


Detector geometry : 50 m side cube of Air  -> World Volume - centered at (0,0,0)
		    30 cm side cube of Air -> Absorber Volume (used for computing the track length and 						     deposited energy) / the half-length of its side should always
		    			     be higher than the track length of an alpha particle in air
		    			     at a certain energy. - centered at (0,0,0)
		    			     
		 +   the beam source is centered at (0,0,0) and is described in the alphabeam.mac file
